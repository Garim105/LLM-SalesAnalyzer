**Explanation**

The code starts by loading sales data from a CSV file into a table (Data Frame) using the pandas’ library. It then cleans this data by performing a few tasks: removing any duplicate rows to ensure each entry is unique, filling in any missing values with zeros so the dataset is complete, and dropping any extra columns that aren’t needed. It sets up the OpenAI API key (a dummy token in this case).

Next, the code uses an OpenAI language model to analyse the data. It converts the data into a format that the model can understand and sends it a question. The question asks the model to identify which columns are categories (like dates or names) and which are numbers. 

Once the model provides its suggestions, the code uses these recommendations to create visualizations. For instance, if the model suggests a bar chart to show sales by region, the code generates that chart. It might also create a line chart if the model recommends visualizing sales over time. Each chart is made to be clear and informative, with proper titles and labels.

Finally, the code puts everything together: it loads and cleans the data, gets recommendations from the language model, creates the charts based on those suggestions, and prints out the model’s analysis and recommendations. This helps in understanding and presenting the sales data in a clear and organized way.
