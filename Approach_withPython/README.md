**Explanation**
Data Loading and Cleaning:
- Reads a CSV file, removes duplicates, and fills missing values.
- Converts date columns to a standardized format and drops irrelevant columns.

Dimension and Measure Detection:
- Automatically identifies dimensions (e.g., categories, dates) and measures (e.g., sales, revenue) from the dataset.

Descriptive Analysis:
- Computes statistics (mean, sum, count) for measures.
- Groups measures by dimensions for detailed insights.

Visualization:
- Creates bar plots for measures against dimensions.
- Splits large dimensions into smaller chunks for better visualization when needed.
